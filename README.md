👋 Hi, I’m Rabia, a passionate tech learner based in Manchester.

👀 With a background in architecture and design, I'm now diving into the world of technology.

🌱 Currently, earning full stack development and exploring the newest advancements in technology at [CodeYourFuture](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture).

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that fuse creativity and innovative solutions in the tech industry.
