👋 Hi, I’m Rabia, a passionate tech learner based in Manchester.

👀 I have a background and experience in architecture and design.

🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development and exploring the newest advancements in technology at [CodeYourFuture](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve innovative solutions and creativity in the tech industry.

📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn: [Rabia Avci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rabia-avci-5231032b/)

⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from being an architect to a tech learner and full stack developer, embracing the challenge with patience and enthusiasm.
